    I was born at a young age of zero months in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. &nbsp;
    I am now 247 months old. &nbsp;
    In my trek for an education I went to the school district known as Mt. Lebanon. &nbsp;
    As a young lad, I  enjoyed learning, thinking while walking aimlessly, challenging myself, and technology. &nbsp;
    Growing up, I was always a chubby kid probably because when I was first introduced to the internet, I was hooked and a user for life. &nbsp;
    Well, I have not lived all of my life yet so I can not be so sure. &nbsp;
    Let's skip a couple chapters to when I lost a good fifty pounds the summer after junior year of high school. &nbsp; 
    Oddly enough, I did not decide to become a computer science major until I was about to start my senior year. &nbsp;
    My family and friends in school would usually come to me with their technology woes. &nbsp;
    Throughout high school I spent many hours helping others in the community. &nbsp;
    I truly believe that giving is better than receiving, and have centered my, albeit short, career around helping others. &nbsp;
    Plus, my love for learning, yes I was the kid that did not like it when school was cancelled, allowed me to get through college in three years and along the way become a Peer Tutor and Undergraduate Teaching Assistant. &nbsp;
    I am interested in a plethora of computer science areas ranging from software engineering and web development to mobile applications and security. &nbsp;
    I am planning to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh in Spring 2016 and am currently looking for a job post-graduation.
