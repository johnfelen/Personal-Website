# Personal-Website
This project is of my personal website which is at <a href="www.johnfelen.com">www.johnfelen.com</a>.  If you are on my website, I hope you have enjoyed the show.  This website is a hub and extension of my résumé, LinkedIn, and GitHub.  At first this website was just a fully front-end website but after taking the Programming Languages for Web Applications I updated it to have server side functionality.  The current iteration of the website uses HTML, CSS(preprocessed using SASS), Bootstrap, JavaScript(and jQuery), PHP and a bit of MySQL(all of these entries in my portfolio are stored in a database).  While creating this project I learned SASS, jQuery and PHP.  It is easier to look through the website than read a description about it, so have a look around.
